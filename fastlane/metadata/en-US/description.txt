Chiff allows you to log in to any website using your phone, making logging in safer and simpler.

In order to be secure, you must use LONG, COMPLEX and UNIQUE passwords for all your accounts. But how can you remember this? 

With Chiff you can easily log in to any website using TouchID or FaceID on both your mobile phone and desktop. You never have to remember a single password, not even a master password. Chiff can be paired with your browser, so you can simply authorize logins with your fingerprint or face.

So, say goodbye to forgetting passwords, say hello to Chiff.

-	Log in with your phone
-	Remember 0 passwords

-	Passwords are only stored on your phone
-	Use long, complex and unique passwords for all accounts

Chiff never has the key to your sensitive data. Your passwords are only stored locally on your phone and every message between the app and browser is end-to-end encrypted, so even we cannot decrypt it. Besides very secure, it makes Chiff also very privacy-friendly.

You can now use Chiff for FREE for personal use.
