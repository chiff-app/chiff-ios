### Privacy policy

#### Introduction
Keyn BV processes some personally identifiable information to be able to provide the services of Keyn BV, and/or because you provided the information directly to Keyn BV, for instance by filling out the contact form on the website. Keyn BV processes the following personally identifiable information about you:

* Username
* Email address
* IP-address

Keyn is designed with privacy and data security as a foundation. In this privacy policy you can find what information we need from you, why we need it and how we ensure its confidentiality.

#### Company information
Keyn allows you to log into any website using your phone, making logging in safer and simpler. We leverage the biometric authentication mechanisms on your phone, so you don’t have to remember a single password anymore. Moreover, since your password are only stored locally on your phone, it is an extra factor in the login process. If you have any questions regarding Keyn’s privacy policy, you can contact us at:

Keyn BV  
Langegracht 70

#### Purpose data collection
Keyn has several purposes why your data is needed:

* **Email marketing**: If you subscribe to our mailing list, we use your email address to keep you informed about Keyn’s progress and development. Each email contains a link where you can unsubscribe from the mailing list.
* **Mobile application**: If you download the Keyn app, an application on your phone, you will be presented a seed consisting of twelve random words. This seed is unique for each person and serves as the key to encrypt all your personal data. Since the seed never leaves your phone and passwords are only stored locally, your data is inaccessible to us. To make sure you can restore your accounts if you would lose your phone, Keyn needs to store some data (websites and usernames) remotely. This data encrypted with a cryptographic key that is derived from your seed. This ensures that we cannot read this data. Since we do not have the technical ability to decrypt your information, we are unable to hand over your data to third parties in an unencrypted form. 
* **Improvement**: To constantly improve Keyn, we measure how and when Keyn is used. This helps us to improve Keyn. The IP-address will be logged to determine the geographical distribution.
* **Website optimization**: Keyn BV uses Google analytics to keep track how visitors use the website and how effective Adwords campaigns of Keyn BV are. The collected information is transferred together with your IP-address to Google, which stores the data on servers in the USA. Google uses the information to inform and provide reports to Keyn BV about the usage of the website. Google might transfer this information to third parties, if they are legally obliged to do so, or as far as third parties process the information on behalf of Google. Keyn BV has no influence on this process. Keyn BV has granted Google permission to use the analytics data, which is collected via Keyn BV, for other Google services. For more information, you can read Google’s privacy policy.

#### Security
For Keyn BV information security is of major importance. Keyn BV takes all possible measures to prevent abuse, loss, unauthorized access, unwanted disclosure and unwanted modification of personal information. The website of Keyn BV uses TLS to encrypt communication for the website and backend.
Additionally, all communication between your device and the browser extension is end-to-end encrypted with cryptographic keys that are only accessible to the user. Keyn BV does not have the technical ability to decrypt your information and as a result, Keyn BV is unable to hand your data over to third parties in a decrypted form.
