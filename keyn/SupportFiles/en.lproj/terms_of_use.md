#### ARTICLE 3: FORMATION AND AMENDMENT OF THE CONTRACT

**3.1.** A contract between the Parties is formed as soon as the User downloads and/or uses the Application, or as soon as the User uses Chiff’s Services in any other manner.

**4.1.** The User can only use the Services in so far as the User has the appropriate or necessary equipment, including, but not limited to, a smartphone or tablet, as well as access to internet, e.g. (without limitation) by means of a subscription at a telecommunications service.   
**4.2.** As soon as the Mobile Application is installed, the latter will generate a unique and random Random Seed. The User’s passwords will be derived from this Random Seed. The Random Seed can be represented as twelve (12) words (‘Paper Back-up’).   
**4.3.** The User is responsible for the safekeeping of their Paper Back-up. Chiff does not accept any liability for this in any way.

**4.5.** The User’s passwords are only stored on the User’s smartphone or tablet. Chiff has no access to the User’s passwords. Chiff is in no way able to restore or retrieve the User’s secured data. The User can restore or retrieve their secured data themselves by means of their Paper Back-up.   
**4.6.** In order to restore an account by means of the Paper Back-up, Chiff will store the following User data: (i) websites at which the User has an account; (ii) the User’s user names; and (iii) other configuration data. These data are encrypted and are not accessible to Chiff.

#### ARTICLE 6: PAYMENT

**6.1.** In the event of a Subscription, the User must pay any amounts owed to Chiff through a direct debit. The availability of the relevant payment method depends on various factors, such as the User’s location and the User’s bank. Therefore, Chiff cannot guarantee the proper functioning of the payment method.   
**6.2.** In the event that the User has not paid within the payment term determined by Chiff, the User is legally in default without any prior notice of default being required.   
**6.3.** Any complaints about the prices and costs charged to the User can be lodged with Chiff in writing within fourteen (14) days after the relevant amounts have been paid by the User to Chiff or after the invoice date, such at the risk of forfeiting all rights.

In any event, the User will owe Chiff the incurred collection costs in the event of a money claim. The amount of the collection costs is calculated in conformity with the Dutch Extrajudicial Collection Costs (Standards) Act (‘Wet Normering Buitengerechtelijke Incassokosten’) with a minimum amount of €40 (exclusive of VAT). Any reasonable legal and execution costs will also be at the User’s expense.   
**6.5.** Payments made by the User will initially serve to pay all interest and costs due, and subsequently to settle the longest outstanding invoices, even if the User states that the payment is for a later invoice.
